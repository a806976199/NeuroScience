This section states the questions that we can't solve or the concepts that we can't understand.
\label{sec:questions}
For the first chapter, we have the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We already understand the article's descriptive explanation of
Equation \ref{equ:1.6}, but don't know how to derive it
mathematically.
\item For Equation \ref{equ:1.24}, we don't know how to derive the unit of the standard deviation $\sigma_s$ from Equation \ref{equ:1.23}. (Here, it said that $\sigma_s$ has the units of the stimulus times the square root of the unit of time. This fact can derive from the derivation in Appendix A.)
\item We do not fully understand the derivation of Equation \ref{equ:1.36} from \ref{equ:1.35}.
\item We have doubts about the author's interpretation of Equation
\ref{equ:1.37}, which says that if the spike times are not ordered, a
change can be made to the formula. But Generally, time
originally has its own sequence.
